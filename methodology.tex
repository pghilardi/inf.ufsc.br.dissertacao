Use \cite{evermann:07} profile to structural representation of AspectJ but withsome changes. Change 'Operation Pointcut' that points to meta-class 'Operation'or meta-class 'Field'. Now these pointcuts will point for the trigger state. Andwhich trigger this pointcut will be described on state machine diagram.* Removed stereotypes: - CompositePointCut: Composition now will be done automatically on state machine diagrams (automatic composition) -> OR, AND, NOT* Not impacted stereotypes: These stereotypes will remain with same semantic - StaticCrossCuttingFeature (onType) : Inter-type declarations * Impacted stereotypes: These stereotypes will point to the 'trigger state'. - GetPointCut - SetPointCut - AdviceExecutionPointcut - PreInitializationPointCut - InitializationPointCut - WithinCodePointCut - ExecutionPointCut - CallPointCut - ThisPointCut (types, args) - ArgsPointCut (types, args) - TargetPointCut (types, args) - StaticInitializationPointCut (type) - ExceptionPointCut (type) - WithinPointCut (type) - CFlowBelowPointCut - CFlowPointCut Create profile to add stereotypes on states (state-machine diagram): One new stereotype named 'Pointcut'. States with this stereotype can be pointed as  pointcuts on structural diagram. Pointcut expression will be defined on transition. - Advice: Advice on structural diagram will simply point to a sequence diagram that realizes the advice behavior. A pointcut will be added as a 'State Invariant' on advice sequence diagram indicating if advice execution type is 'before', 'after' or 'around'. This will be represented graphically by user and composition will be automatized resulting on a composed diagram between base and advice diagrams.
