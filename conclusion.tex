\chapter{Conclusion}

This work has proposed an approach to model aspect-oriented systems using UML, with a lightweight profile that allows to implement an aspect
visualizer in the SEA environment. The SEA/Aspect tool performs the composition between core and crosscutting models automatically, allowing the visualization of
the aspect dynamics in a system.

\section{Main Contributions}

The main advantages of the proposed approach in relation to the others are: the representation of the important characteristics of the AOP, like the
capture of multiple join points with the representation of the aspect behavior; the definition of a profile within the UML standards, which can be
added in CASE tools that support importing profiles, and the composition and automatic visualization of the effect of the crosscutting models in the
core models in the SEA environment, which eases the understanding and maintenance of aspect-oriented systems. The tool that allows the composition and
visualization toggling of concerns may be added to CASE tools that allow functional extension, which is the case of the SEA environment.
